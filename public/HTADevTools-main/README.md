### How to use HTADevTools
  1. Create a new .hta application.
  2. Add \<link> and \<script> tags to the \<head> of your applications pointing to the respective HTADevTools files.
  3. Add the element in htadevtools.html into  your body.
  
### Who is this for?
  
  - Developers looking to move away from VBScript and have a semi-reasonable debugging process.
  - Developers under a tight set of limitations for solution creation, with .hta being the only solution.
  - People looking to reinvent the wheel.
